		<h1>Who am I?</h1>
		<p>I am a man truly inspired by Dr.A.P.J Abdul Kalam who specifies that we dont need fancy technology to make innovations, just need the right mind and the temperment to innovate at home. I feel like his Mission 2020 might not been achieved, But its not far off, and i aim to be the ideal citizen of India, to achieve that. It also gives me great joy as I have read all of his books and all of them lead to innovation in technology for the common strata of society and to make innovations        affordable to the people and yet change their lives forever. This is my true aim in life. To produce something not only is innovative, but also affordable.
			<br><br>
       I am also passionate about his ideal of spreading knowledge as much as possible and not achieve as an individual, but achieve as a nation
