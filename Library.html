          <p>What Books I Like?</p>
          <p>For me, A book that doesn't let you sleep at night and stays with a constant tempo throughout the entirity
            of the book is one that I woulld pick up. But then again, There are certain titles that I might have overlooked

          Please feel free to suggest any book that you think might interest me!</p>

        <div class="panel" id="contact">
          <p>What are some of my favourite gernes?</p>
          <p>For me, its gotta be Sci-Fi or Mythology as they are extremely fascinating.
             Other than that, I love political discourse and speech-oriented books!</p>
